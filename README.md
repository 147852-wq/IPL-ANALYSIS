# IPL-ANALYSIS
Problem Definition

The Indian Premier League (IPL) generates massive volumes of cricket data every season, including match results, ball-by-ball commentary, player performances, and team statistics.
While fans and analysts have access to raw data, extracting actionable insights such as:

Which players are most consistent?

How toss decisions affect match results?

Which venues favor batting/bowling?

Which teams dominate across seasons?

…is not straightforward without systematic data analysis.

Hence, the problem is:
👉 “How can we analyze IPL historical data to identify patterns in team performances, player achievements (Orange Cap, Purple Cap), and match outcomes (toss decisions, venues, result types) using PostgreSQL and visualize them in Power BI?”

🎯 Objectives of the Project

Data Management & Integration

Collect IPL data (matches, ball-by-ball, players).

Store and query efficiently using PostgreSQL.

Player Performance Analysis

Identify top run-scorers (Orange Cap).

Identify top wicket-takers (Purple Cap).

Calculate batting strike rates, averages, boundary counts, economy rates for bowlers.

Team & Season Analysis

Determine season champions and team-wise wins.

Compare team performance across different venues.

Highlight consistent franchises (e.g., MI, CSK).

Match Outcome Factors

Analyze the impact of toss decisions (bat/field first) on results.

Explore win patterns by result type (runs, wickets, super over).

Venue Analysis

Identify which stadiums favor batting vs. bowling.

Highlight home advantage impact.

Visualization (Dashboard in Power BI)

Create a Season Overview: Title Winner, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, Total 4s & 6s.

Player Stats Pages: Select Batsman, Select Bowler cards.

Match Insights: Wins by Venue, Toss Impact, Result Type.

Team Analysis: Team-wise wins across seasons.

✅ Expected Outcome:

A structured PostgreSQL database with IPL data.

SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

A Power BI Dashboard that presents IPL stats in an interactive, user-friendly manner.

Actionable insights for cricket fans, analysts, and teams.
